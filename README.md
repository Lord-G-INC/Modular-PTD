# SMG2 Project Template Debug
This is the **Project Template Debug** for Super Mario Galaxy 2 in the new Modular Syati style. PTD adds tons of things, including the Red and Blue Coin Systems, ports of the Red Star and Ice Flower, custom objects and much much more. To compile these modules, please use [SyatiManager](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/SyatiManager) to set it up correctly.

## Contributing
If you wanna contribute, please do the following things:
1. Build your module based on the [SyatiModuleTemplate](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/SyatiModuleTemplate) or any other Syati Manager preset. 
2. Add the module inside a new folder that quickly describes what it is, for example `CrystalBox`. Folder names should not contain spaces.
3. To publish it for anyone to use, add it to [Modules.json](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/SyatiManager/blob/main/SyatiManager/Components/Modules.json). Check [this](https://github.com/SMGCommunity/SyatiManager/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-modules-to-the-module-library) for instructions on how to add new entries.
